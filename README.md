   We will develop an application so that every student can access the comprehensive library 
service provided by Ankara Y覺ld覺r覺m Beyaz覺t University with one click. We will define a QR 
Code for all books defined in the system. In this way, students will be able to scan the QR 
code of the book they want and get their book via the application without contacting the 
library officer. In the additional interface we will design, students will be able to reserve the 
book they want online. The QR Code of the reserved book will be inactive for 24 hours.

# Business Opportunity
 This will only be an improvement that allows us to receive the book within 24 hours and the 
same person will not be able to revise the same book more than once. In other words, if the 
revised book is not received from the library within 24 hours, it will not be revised again.

# Business Objectives

 Thanks to QR Code technology, library staff will not have to follow up any input and 
output. Books received via QR code will automatically be dropped from the system. Students 
will be able to select the rental day of the book that they have read the QR code on the system, 
thus preventing a malfunction in the system. Students who receive a notification on the return 
day on their phone will be able to extend the rental period for a certain day. The QR code of 
the returned books will become active and will be open to use again. With such a practical 
system, students will be able to see and revise the book they are looking for before they come 
to the library. The aim of the project is to reduce the workload of the targeted library staff and 
to expand the use of the library
